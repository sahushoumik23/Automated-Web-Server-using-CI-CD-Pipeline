Hello There,

I am Shoumik Sahu and I was given the task to create an Automation system that will perform the following tasks shown below.

I  have tried my best to explain each and every step done to make the project...

1. I created a folder in my BaseOS(Redhat Linux 8) :
    mkdir /root/Desktop/New_job
    cd /root/Desktop/New_job
2.  We were supposed to do the tasks given by vimal daga sir:

<h1><b>First Task</b></h1>
1st Task was to create an image that will have jenkins installed in it...
  <ol>
  <li>We need to create a file named Dockerfile in the folder....I named it New_job...
    <img src="C:\Users\91934\Desktop\Task2\Dockerfile.png">
    
    <br>
